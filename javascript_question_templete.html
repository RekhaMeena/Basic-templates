    <h1>All the Best for your Spy Test!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to generic website that will seem to
       ask mundane question to normal users,
       but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting
       your website will be asked a series of questions,
       only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect.
       If all questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret
       message in console for
       the Spy to read!</p>

    <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
      <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30(exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
      <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall</li>
      <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I would suggest you use Javascript to prompt the user for information and set these to variables.
    Then use these variables to check for four conditions to all
  be true. It's up to oyu what the Secret message is!</p>

  <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Name of the spy</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Pet name</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want,
  you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name.</p>

  <p>Also remember to switch out the script src to your own.js file right now it's
  connected to .html which contains the solutions.</p>
